### 📢 New Release for Windows & macOS Desktop, Welcome to Test and Provide Feedback [Documentation is a bit outdated, ongoing updates]

 ## Project Introduction  

Krillin AI is a versatile audio and video localization and enhancement solution. This minimalist yet powerful tool integrates video translation, dubbing, and voice cloning, supporting both landscape and portrait formats to ensure perfect presentation on all major platforms (Bilibili, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, WeChat Video, Kuaishou, YouTube, TikTok, etc.). With an end-to-end workflow, Krillin AI can transform raw materials into polished, ready-to-use cross-platform content with just a few clicks.

## Key Features and Functions:
🎯 **One-Click Start**: No complex environment setup required, automatic dependency installation, ready to use immediately, with a new desktop version for easier access!

📥 **Video Acquisition**: Supports downloading via yt-dlp or local file uploads.

📜 **Accurate Recognition**: High-accuracy speech recognition based on Whisper.

🧠 **Intelligent Segmentation**: Subtitle segmentation and alignment using LLM.

🔄 **Terminology Replacement**: One-click replacement of specialized vocabulary.

🌍 **Professional Translation**: LLM-based paragraph-level translation maintaining semantic coherence.

🎙️ **Voice Cloning**: Offers selected voice tones from CosyVoice or custom voice cloning.

🎬 **Video Composition**: Automatically handles landscape and portrait video and subtitle layout.

## Effect Demonstration
The image below shows the effect of the subtitle file generated after importing a 46-minute local video and executing it with one click, without any manual adjustments. There are no omissions or overlaps, the sentence breaks are natural, and the translation quality is very high.

## Interface Preview
![Interface Preview](/docs/images/ui_desktop.png)

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Basic Steps
First, download the executable file that matches your device system from the [Release](https://github.com/krillinai/KrillinAI/releases), then follow the tutorial below to choose between the desktop version or non-desktop version, and place it in an empty folder. Downloading the software into an empty folder is recommended as it will generate some directories after running, making it easier to manage.

【For the desktop version, i.e., release files with "desktop" in the name, see here】  
_The desktop version is newly released to address the issue of novice users struggling to edit configuration files correctly, and there are still some bugs, ongoing updates._
1. Double-click the file to start using it (the desktop version also requires configuration within the software).

【For the non-desktop version, i.e., release files without "desktop" in the name, see here】  
_The non-desktop version is the initial version, with a more complex configuration but stable functionality, suitable for server deployment as it provides a UI via web._
1. Create a `config` folder within the directory, then create a `config.toml` file inside the `config` folder. Copy the contents of the `config-example.toml` file from the source code `config` directory into `config.toml`, and fill in your configuration information accordingly.
2. Double-click or execute the executable file in the terminal to start the service.
3. Open your browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:8888` to start using it (replace 8888 with the port you filled in the configuration file).

### To: macOS Users
【For the desktop version, i.e., release files with "desktop" in the name, see here】  
Due to signing issues, the desktop version currently cannot be run directly by double-clicking or installed via DMG; you need to manually trust the application. The method is as follows:
1. Open the terminal in the directory where the executable file (assuming the file name is KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64) is located.
2. Execute the following commands in order:
```
sudo xattr -cr ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64
sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64 
./KrillinAI_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64
```

【For the non-desktop version, i.e., release files without "desktop" in the name, see here】  
This software is not signed, so when running on macOS, after completing the file configuration in the "Basic Steps," you also need to manually trust the application. The method is as follows:
1. Open the terminal in the directory where the executable file (assuming the file name is KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64) is located.
2. Execute the following commands in order:
   ```
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    sudo chmod +x ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    ./KrillinAI_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    ```
    This will start the service.

### Docker Deployment
This project supports Docker deployment; please refer to the [Docker Deployment Instructions](./docker.md).

### Cookie Configuration Instructions (Optional)

If you encounter issues with video downloads failing,

please refer to the [Cookie Configuration Instructions](./get_cookies.md) to configure your Cookie information.

### Configuration Help (Must Read)
The quickest and easiest configuration method:
* Set both `transcription_provider` and `llm_provider` to `openai`, so you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` in the three configuration categories below: `openai`, `local_model`, and `aliyun`. (`app.proxy`, `model`, and `openai.base_url` can be filled in as needed).

Using a local language recognition model (not yet supported on macOS) configuration method (balancing cost, speed, and quality):
* Set `transcription_provider` to `fasterwhisper` and `llm_provider` to `openai`, so you only need to fill in `openai.apikey` and `local_model.faster_whisper` in the three configuration categories below: `openai` and `local_model`. The local model will be downloaded automatically. (`app.proxy` and `openai.base_url` as above).

For the following usage scenarios, Alibaba Cloud configuration is required:
* If `llm_provider` is set to `aliyun`, you need to use Alibaba Cloud's large model service, so you need to configure the `aliyun.bailian` item.
* If `transcription_provider` is set to `aliyun`, or if the "Dubbing" feature is enabled when starting a task, you need to use Alibaba Cloud's speech service, so you need to fill in the `aliyun.speech` item.
* If the "Dubbing" feature is enabled and you have uploaded local audio for voice cloning, you will also need to use Alibaba Cloud's OSS cloud storage service, so you need to fill in the `aliyun.oss` item.  
Alibaba Cloud configuration help: [Alibaba Cloud Configuration Instructions](./aliyun.md).
