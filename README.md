 ## Project Introduction  ([Try the online version now!](https://www.klic.studio/))

Klic Studio is a versatile audio and video localization and enhancement solution developed by Krillin AI. This minimalist yet powerful tool integrates video translation, dubbing, and voice cloning, supporting both landscape and portrait formats to ensure perfect presentation on all major platforms (Bilibili, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, WeChat Video, Kuaishou, YouTube, TikTok, etc.). With an end-to-end workflow, you can transform raw materials into beautifully ready-to-use cross-platform content with just a few clicks.

## Key Features and Functions:
üéØ **One-click Start**: No complex environment configuration required, automatic dependency installation, ready to use immediately, with a new desktop version for easier access!

üì• **Video Acquisition**: Supports yt-dlp downloads or local file uploads

üìú **Accurate Recognition**: High-accuracy speech recognition based on Whisper

üß† **Intelligent Segmentation**: Subtitle segmentation and alignment using LLM

üîÑ **Terminology Replacement**: One-click replacement of professional vocabulary 

üåç **Professional Translation**: LLM translation with context to maintain natural semantics

üéôÔ∏è **Voice Cloning**: Offers selected voice tones from CosyVoice or custom voice cloning

üé¨ **Video Composition**: Automatically processes landscape and portrait videos and subtitle layout

üíª **Cross-Platform**: Supports Windows, Linux, macOS, providing both desktop and server versions


## Effect Demonstration
The image below shows the effect of the subtitle file generated after importing a 46-minute local video and executing it with one click, without any manual adjustments. There are no omissions or overlaps, the segmentation is natural, and the translation quality is very high.

## Interface Preview
![Interface Preview](/docs/images/ui_desktop.png)


## üöÄ Quick Start
### Basic Steps
First, download the executable file that matches your device system from the [Release](https://github.com/KrillinAI/KlicStudio/releases), then follow the tutorial below to choose between the desktop version or non-desktop version. Place the software download in an empty folder, as running it will generate some directories, and keeping it in an empty folder will make management easier.  

„ÄêIf it is the desktop version, i.e., the release file with "desktop," see here„Äë  
_The desktop version is newly released to address the issues of new users struggling to edit configuration files correctly, and there are some bugs that are continuously being updated._
1. Double-click the file to start using it (the desktop version also requires configuration within the software)

„ÄêIf it is the non-desktop version, i.e., the release file without "desktop," see here„Äë  
_The non-desktop version is the initial version, which has a more complex configuration but is stable in functionality and suitable for server deployment, as it provides a UI in a web format._
1. Create a `config` folder within the folder, then create a `config.toml` file in the `config` folder. Copy the contents of the `config-example.toml` file from the source code's `config` directory into `config.toml`, and fill in your configuration information according to the comments.
2. Double-click or execute the executable file in the terminal to start the service 
3. Open your browser and enter `http://127.0.0.1:8888` to start using it (replace 8888 with the port you specified in the configuration file)

### To: macOS Users
„ÄêIf it is the desktop version, i.e., the release file with "desktop," see here„Äë  
Due to signing issues, the desktop version currently cannot be double-clicked to run or installed via dmg; you need to manually trust the application. The method is as follows:
1. Open the terminal in the directory where the executable file (assuming the file name is KlicStudio_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64) is located
2. Execute the following commands in order:
```
sudo xattr -cr ./KlicStudio_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64
sudo chmod +x ./KlicStudio_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64 
./KlicStudio_1.0.0_desktop_macOS_arm64
```

„ÄêIf it is the non-desktop version, i.e., the release file without "desktop," see here„Äë  
This software is not signed, so when running on macOS, after completing the file configuration in the "Basic Steps," you also need to manually trust the application. The method is as follows:
1. Open the terminal in the directory where the executable file (assuming the file name is KlicStudio_1.0.0_macOS_arm64) is located
2. Execute the following commands in order:
   ```
    sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine ./KlicStudio_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    sudo chmod +x ./KlicStudio_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    ./KlicStudio_1.0.0_macOS_arm64
    ```
    This will start the service

### Docker Deployment
This project supports Docker deployment; please refer to the [Docker Deployment Instructions](./docker.md)

### Cookie Configuration Instructions (Optional)

If you encounter issues with video downloads

Please refer to the [Cookie Configuration Instructions](./get_cookies.md) to configure your Cookie information.

### Configuration Help (Must Read)
The quickest and easiest configuration method:
* Fill in `transcribe.provider.name` with `openai`, so you only need to fill in the `transcribe.openai` block and the large model configuration in the `llm` block to perform subtitle translation. (`app.proxy`, `model`, and `openai.base_url` can be filled in as needed)

Using a local speech recognition model configuration method (balancing cost, speed, and quality):
* Fill in `transcribe.provider.name` with `fasterwhisper`, `transcribe.fasterwhisper.model` with `large-v2`, and then fill in the `llm` block with the large model configuration to perform subtitle translation. The local model will be automatically downloaded and installed. (`app.proxy` and `openai.base_url` are the same as above)

Text-to-speech (TTS) is optional; the configuration logic is the same as above. Fill in `tts.provider.name`, and then fill in the corresponding configuration block under `tts`. The voice codes in the UI should be filled in according to the documentation of the selected provider (the documentation address is in the common questions section below). Filling in Alibaba Cloud's AccessKey, Bucket, AppKey, etc., may be repetitive to ensure a clear configuration structure.  
Note: If using voice cloning, `tts` only supports selecting `aliyun`.

**For obtaining Alibaba Cloud AccessKey, Bucket, and AppKey, please read**: [Alibaba Cloud Configuration Instructions](./aliyun.md) 

Please understand that the task = speech recognition + large model translation + voice service (TTS, etc., optional), which will help you understand the configuration file better.

### Complete Workflow Example

Here's a complete example of using the API to transcribe and translate a YouTube video:

```bash
# 1. Start a subtitle task
TASK_RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/capability/subtitleTask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "app_id": 1,
    "url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ",
    "origin_lang": "en",
    "target_lang": "zh",
    "bilingual": 1,
    "tts": 0,
    "language": "en"
  }')

# Extract task ID
TASK_ID=$(echo $TASK_RESPONSE | jq -r '.data.task_id')
echo "Task ID: $TASK_ID"

# 2. Poll for completion
while true; do
  STATUS_RESPONSE=$(curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8888/api/capability/subtitleTask?taskId=$TASK_ID")
  PERCENT=$(echo $STATUS_RESPONSE | jq -r '.data.process_percent')
  echo "Progress: $PERCENT%"
  
  if [ "$PERCENT" = "100" ]; then
    echo "Task completed!"
    echo $STATUS_RESPONSE | jq '.data'
    break
  fi
  
  sleep 10
done

# 3. Download generated files
echo $STATUS_RESPONSE | jq -r '.data.subtitle_info[].download_url' | while read url; do
  if [ "$url" != "null" ] && [ "$url" != "" ]; then
    filename=$(basename "$url")
    curl -O "$url"
    echo "Downloaded: $filename"
  fi
done
```

### Error Handling

The API returns error responses in the following format:

```json
{
  "error": -1,
  "msg": "Error description",
  "data": null
}
```

Common error messages:
- `"invalid YouTube URL"` - Invalid YouTube video URL
- `"invalid Bilibili URL"` - Invalid Bilibili video URL
- `"failed to download and extract audio"` - Video download or audio extraction failed
- `"failed to transcribe audio"` - Speech recognition failed
- `"‰ªªÂä°‰∏çÂ≠òÂú®"` - Task not found
- `"‰ªªÂä°Â§±Ë¥•"` - Task processing failed

### Rate Limiting

Currently, there are no rate limits implemented. However, it's recommended to:
- Wait for task completion before starting new tasks
- Use appropriate delays between API calls
- Monitor server resources during heavy usage

### Supported Video Sources

- **YouTube**: Full URLs or video IDs
- **Bilibili**: Full URLs or video IDs  
- **Local Files**: Use `local:./path/to/file.mp4` format
